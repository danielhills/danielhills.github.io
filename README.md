### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan, a data scientist based in London. I'm currently working at Spotify alongside volunteering with the [London Cycling Campaign](https://lcc.org.uk/) to better identify dangerous junctions in London for cyclists & pedestrians. The rest of the time I'm riding my bike.

This website exists to store my writing, personal projects & other bits.
