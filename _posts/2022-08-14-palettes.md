# Seaborn Palettes

`2022-08-14`

Sometimes it's hard to find a good palette for plotting. Use [this notebook](https://github.com/danielhills/code-snippets/blob/master/python/plotting/seaborn_palettes.ipynb) for example paletter plots of all seaborn palettes.

Note, it's sometimes helpful to re-run on your own machine to see how it will actually render.
